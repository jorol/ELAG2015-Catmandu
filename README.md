Catmandu Bootcamp at ELAG 2015

## Proposal

__Title:__ Catmandu - a (meta)data toolkit

__Name(s):__ ...

__Expected time slot:__ 6 hours

__Audience:__ Systems librarians, Metadata librarians, Data manager. 

__Expertise:__ Participants should be familiar with command line interfaces (CLI).

__Required:__ Laptop with VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads> installed. Organisers will provide a VirtualBox image (Linux guest system) beforehand. Participants can also install their own environment, see <https://github.com/LibreCat/Catmandu/wiki/Installation>. Participants could bring their own data (CSV, JSON, MAB2, MARC, PICA+, XLS, YAML).

__Programming experience:__ Not required.

__Short description:__ Catmandu <http://librecat.org/Catmandu/> provides a suite of software modules to ease the import, storage, retrieval, export and transformation of (meta)data records. After a short introduction to Catmandu and its features, we will present the command line interface (CLI) and the domain specific language (DSL). Participants will be guided to get data via APIs, to transform data records to a common data model, to store/index it in Elasticsearch <http://www.elasticsearch.org/> or MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.org/>, to query data from stores and to export it to different formats.
